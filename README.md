DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

TASK DESCRIPTION:

This task is to make a basic speech recognition system with an Arduino UNO and an LED.  The system listens to voice commands sent from an Android phone over Bluetooth.  The mobile app turns voice commands like "ON" or "OFF" into text and sends them to the Arduino through a Bluetooth module (HC-05). The Arduino takes these commands and turns the LED on or off.  This task shows how to use Bluetooth to control speech and Arduino to control digital output.

COMPONENTS USED:

    Arduino UNO

    HC-05 Bluetooth Module

    LED

    220Ω Resistor

    Relay Module

    Breadboard and Jumper Wires

    Android Phone with Serial Bluetooth Terminal App

WORKING PRINCIPLE:

The user says "ON" or "OFF" into the Android app.
The app turns speech into text and sends it to Arduino UNO over Bluetooth (HC-05).
The serial port lets Arduino read the command that comes in.
The LED turns on when the command is "ON."  The LED goes out when it's "OFF."
